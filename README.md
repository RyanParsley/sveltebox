# SvelteBox

A collection of components to speed up development with svelte.

This Project is meant to be used as a lib, so all the good bits are in the lib
directory. The routes are only used for documentation.

## Documentation

Documentation is hosted via github pages at
https://ryanparsley.github.io/sveltebox/.

### Update the docs

``` Bash
npm run build:docs
npm run deploy
```
## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
